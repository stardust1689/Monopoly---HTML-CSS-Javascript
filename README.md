=====================================================================

UPDATE ON SEPTEMBER 30th, 2020

CHANGES:

- Properties, players, and tokens changed from raw objects to prototype objects to better align with JS's object-oriented programming and to mitigate the repeating code found in the original version

- Fixed a bug which prevents the players' names from reseting upon hitting the "Reset" button on the starting screen

- Fixed a bug which renders the "B&O Railroad" property noncompliant and causes tokens to disappear when they are on its board space
